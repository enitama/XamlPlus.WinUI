# XamlPlus.WinUI

This is a fork of [github.com/rudyhuyn/XamlPlus](https://github.com/rudyhuyn/XamlPlus) to port it from UWP to WinUI 3.

No additional development is intended for this repository beyond the bare minimum necessary for it to function on WinUI 3.

## Known issues

- `Style.ExceptHighContrast` does not seem to work (see the Sample.WinUI project)

Help is appreciated!
